## About development
Building Vrroomz wasn't just about pixels and polygons, it was about crafting a portal to impossible worlds. We needed a platform that could seamlessly translate the magic of VR into an engaging online experience.
React formed the foundation, its component-based structure mirroring the modularity of VR worlds themselves. This ensured smooth performance and dynamic updates, keeping you immersed in the adventure.
SCSS wasn't just about styling buttons and menus. It was about weaving a visual tapestry that hinted at the wonders within. Think breathtaking landscapes rendered in vibrant colors, and impossible heights scaled with smooth transitions.
So, when you browse Vrroomz, you're not just looking at a website, you're peering into a portal. A portal built with code, yes, but also with passion, innovation, and a deep love for exploration.
